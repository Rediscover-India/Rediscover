<p id="p2">India has a very rich variety of flora and fauna.
Different parts of India have different species of animals and plants. Some species of animals 
like the Asiatic lions and the royal Bengal tigers are exclusive to India.
This is a matter of immense pride for India. India also has a vast 
number of valuable medicinal plants. With about 90,000 species of animals, 45,000 types of plants and 2000
species of birds there are 104 national parks, 566 wildlife sanctuaries and 72 bird sanctuaries in India.
